st.markdown("""
**Stratification** in clinical research helps us **compare drug effects** across different patient groups.  
It is useful for:
1. **Understanding subgroup differences** in drug response
2. **Detecting effect modification (interaction)**—whether a drug works differently in one group vs. another
3. **Reducing bias** by controlling for confounding factors

🧪 **Example:** A new blood pressure medication might work **better in younger patients** and have a **weaker effect in older patients**.  
To analyze this, we stratify the data by **age group** and observe the differences.
