    ### Understanding Measures of Association
    
    Measures of association quantify the relationship between an exposure and an outcome.
    They help us understand how strongly an exposure is related to a disease or health outcome.
    
    Let's calculate the three most common measures:
    - **Risk Ratio (RR)** - Also known as relative risk
    - **Odds Ratio (OR)**
    - **Risk Difference (RD)** - Also known as attributable risk

    ### Understanding Measures of Association:
    
    1. **Risk Ratio (RR)**:
       - Divides the risk in the exposed group by the risk in the unexposed group
       - **RR = 1**: No association (equal risk in both groups)
       - **RR > 1**: Exposure increases risk (harmful)
       - **RR < 1**: Exposure decreases risk (protective)
       - Example: RR = 2 means exposed people have twice the risk of unexposed people
    
    2. **Odds Ratio (OR)**:
       - Compares the odds of disease between exposed and unexposed groups
       - Interpreted similarly to the risk ratio
       - Very useful in case-control studies where risks can't be directly calculated
       - Approximates the risk ratio when the disease is rare (<10% in both groups)
    
    3. **Risk Difference (RD)**:
       - Subtracts the risk in the unexposed group from the risk in the exposed group
       - Measures the absolute effect of exposure
       - Used to calculate Number Needed to Treat/Harm (NNT/NNH)
       - Example: RD = 0.1 means exposure increases absolute risk by 10 percentage points
    
    4. **Number Needed to Treat/Harm (NNT/NNH)**:
       - The number of people who need to be exposed to cause or prevent one additional case
       - Calculated as 1 / |Risk Difference|
       - Useful for clinical and public health decision-making
    
    5. **When to Use Each Measure**:
       - **Risk Ratio**: Best for cohort studies and communicating relative effects
       - **Odds Ratio**: Best for case-control studies and rare diseases
       - **Risk Difference**: Best for public health planning and resource allocation

            - Increase `population_size` to see if it affects the stability of the measures
            
            **Simple Challenges:**
            1. Find when the risk ratio and odds ratio are very different
            2. Try a protective exposure by setting `true_risk_ratio` to 0.5
            3. What happens when the disease becomes very common (prevalence > 30%)?
            4. Look at how risk difference changes with disease prevalence

    ### How Measures Differ:
    
    1. **Relationship Between Risk Ratio (RR) and Odds Ratio (OR)**:
       - When a disease is rare (prevalence < 10%), the OR closely approximates the RR
       - As disease prevalence increases, OR and RR can differ substantially
       - For common diseases, OR tends to be further from 1 than RR (more extreme)
       - Example: For a common disease, an RR of 2 might correspond to an OR of 4 or more
    
    2. **Behavior of Risk Difference (RD)**:
       - Risk difference tends to increase with disease prevalence, even with the same RR
       - The maximum possible RD depends on the baseline risk
       - Example: If baseline risk is 1%, max RD is 99%; if baseline risk is 40%, max RD is 60%
    
    3. **Strengths of Each Measure**:
       - **Risk Ratio**: Easy to interpret, consistent across populations with different baseline risks
       - **Odds Ratio**: Can be calculated in any study design, useful for statistical modeling
       - **Risk Difference**: Directly measures public health impact, useful for resource allocation
    
    4. **Limitations of Each Measure**:
       - **Risk Ratio**: Doesn't consider baseline risk, difficult to calculate in case-control studies
       - **Odds Ratio**: Can be misinterpreted as a risk ratio, becomes misleading for common diseases
       - **Risk Difference**: Varies with baseline risk, may not be transferable to other populations
    
    5. **Choosing the Right Measure**:
       - Use **multiple measures** to get a complete picture
       - Consider your **study design** (cohort vs. case-control)
       - Think about your **audience** (clinicians, public health officials, patients)
       - Remember the **disease frequency** in your population
